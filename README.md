## Clustering particle collisions with Quadtree

Quadtree is a hierarchical data structure (tree) used to organize and divide a two-dimensional space into four smaller regions, called quadrants. This process occurs recursively: each internal node of the tree always branches into four children, while the leaf nodes represent the final regions, which do not need to be subdivided further. This structure is especially useful for efficiently storing, manipulating and searching spatial data.

### Quadtree and Physics: Robbie's Challenge

In the high-energy physics lab, Robbie, our curious robot, works with a team of scientists to unravel the mysteries of the universe. During an experiment, Gloria, one of the renowned physicists involved in the research, entrusts Robbie with the task of analyzing the collected samples. She asks him to identify, among the thousands of “hits” - the interaction points where particles emerge after intense collisions - the regions of greatest concentration and calculate the average electrical charge released in these events. Robbie, eager to learn more about the world of particle physics, accepts the challenge and begins working on his code.
